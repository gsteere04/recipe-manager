# Recipe Manager
Basically a super cool recipe book.  Allows you to easily input recipes, and keep track of them by creating a user profile and linking the recipe to said profile.

### 1. Installation
Make sure you clone the GitHub repository, (git clone "SSH Key") and install the requirements via pip install -r requirements.txt.

Make sure you also have the necessary applications to make this as smooth as possible.  (Postgres, PgAdmin)

### 2.  Usage
Use the uvicorn module you installed from the requirements.txt file by running: uvicorn main2:app --reload in the terminal.
